            <h2>Hello,</h2>
            <p>I am a felon. But that does not mean my life is over. It has been 12+ years since my last felon conviction.</p>
            <p>Since then, Iâ€™ve received my GED and went to college. Now, I work as a web developer.</p>
            <p>Life is not over because you messed up, and I want to help remind everyone that it will get better.</p>
            <p>We can work together to help build a better future for felons.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v2R6SZtJAzPDMeQa/?mibextid=LQQJ4d" class="btn-facebook">Follow us on Facebook</a> and share with others.</p>
            <p>We are reaching out to help provide basic lessons on HTML, Web Design, Computer Skills, and so much more.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to provide skills that felons can use to find jobs they can do remotely from home without fear of being turned down by every job out there.</p>
            <p><strong>We can do this!</strong></p>
